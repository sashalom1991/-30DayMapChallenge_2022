# #30DayMapChallenge 2022

This repository contains maps that were created during #30DayMapChallenge in November 2022. During this difficult month of maps, I made 30 maps of various themes, given by this year's maps theme in [30DayMapChallenge]("https://30daymapchallenge.com/" "30DayMapChallenge"). All in all, it was an interesting, challenging, energetic experience of map making and it was incredible. Thanks to all the participants of 2022, who inspired and gave good examples of maps.
