# #30DayMapChallenge 2022

This repository contains maps that were created during #30DayMapChallenge in November 2022. During this difficult month of maps, I made 30 maps of various themes, given by this year's maps theme in [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/). All in all, it was an interesting, challenging, energetic experience of map making and it was incredible. Thanks to all the participants of 2022, who inspired and gave good examples of maps.

## Day 4: Green

On the map view a density of rural population in Ukraine in 2014. As we can see, the density of the rural population is uneven. This shows the specificity of the placement of the rural population in the territory of Ukraine and the long history of territorial development.

## Day 15: Food/drink

I couldn't make a map yesterday due to the lack of electricity. Russia again attacked Ukraine with missiles. An analysis of the location of large shopping supermarkets in the city of Kyiv shows that there are many of them, it is difficult to determine the leaders as such, but ATB is the favorite if you know what I mean) To find zones for opening new ones, it will be necessary to analyze a lot of data.
